# Analysis by Year Added and Type

There are 2 types of shows in the data: TV shows and movies. They are added from 2008 to 2021 on Netflix library. The first Tableau dashboard portrays the number of shows added per year and indicated/colored by the type of show(tv show/cinema).

Despite the data for date/year added stretches back to 2008, it's after 2015 Netflix substantially increases its collection of shows(from upper chart). In each year(especially after 2017), the number of collected/added movies outnumber tv shows by a considerable margin as can be seen from the bar chart. Collection of movies seems to receive more importance. Additionally, from 2015 onwards, the number shows being added rises ever higher indicating vigorous library expansion by Netflix. 

From both the graphs, we see a drop in the number of movies being added from 2019 to 2020. 2020 was the beginning of COVID pandemic. Here, we see the affect of COVID pandemic on movie collection by Netflix. Probably, less movies have been produced worldwide during that time leading to lower number of movies being added to the platform. By contrast, the number of tv shows being added remained nearly same from 2019 to 2020.

In Dashboard 2, named Netflix Map, the distribution of shows by nation is shown. The USA leads the nations with the most number of shows on Netflix library. India comes 2nd. However, in Asia alone, India has the most shows. In Europe, England produces the greatest number of shows on Netflix. Globally, England is 3rd. This top 3 ranking remains the same when 'movies' is chosen from the 'Type' drop-down menu indicating the distribution of Netflix movies produced by the countries.


However, when choosing only TV Shows from the drop-down menu, Japan beats India in Asia meaning Japan produces the most TV shows on Netflix in Asia. Globally, Japan is 3rd trailing behind the UK while the USA is still the top producer of TV shows.
