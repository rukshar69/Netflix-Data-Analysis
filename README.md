# Analysis by Year Added and Type

There are 2 types of shows in the data: TV shows and movies. They are added from 2008 to 2021 on Netflix library. The first Tableau dashboard portrays the number of shows added per year and indicated/colored by the type of show(tv show/cinema).

Despite the data for date/year added stretches back to 2008, it's after 2015 Netflix substantially increases its collection of shows(from upper chart). In each year(especially after 2017), the number of collected/added movies outnumber tv shows by a considerable margin as can be seen from the bar chart. Collection of movies seems to receive more importance. Additionally, from 2015 onwards, the number shows being added rises ever higher indicating vigorous library expansion by Netflix. 

From both the graphs, we see a drop in the number of movies being added from 2019 to 2020. 2020 was the beginning of COVID pandemic. Here, we see the affect of COVID pandemic on movie collection by Netflix. Probably, less movies have been produced worldwide during that time leading to lower number of movies being added to the platform. By contrast, the number of tv shows being added remained nearly same from 2019 to 2020.
